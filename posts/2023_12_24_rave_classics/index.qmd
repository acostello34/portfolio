First song:

* Original Nuttah 25 - Uk Apache, SHY FX
    * Interesting that the break was just a snare roll        
    * very straightforward beat with minimal elements 
    * Bass is left to carry the low end and snare sets the groove
  
* On a Ragga Tip '97 - SL2
    * Also simple. Kick, Snare, HH, Bass, Synth Riff, Vocals
    
* Beep Street - Squarepusher
    * Man this snare roll is so sick (intro)
    * (1 min 20 sec) I can really hear the influence on more recent artists. For some reason, Tycho jumps to mind with this snare groove
    * I listened to Awake earlier today but also picked up a boards of canada vinyl the other week
