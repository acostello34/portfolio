I would also like to go through some of my graduate course work to pull out and save interesting projects. I loved the MS program at Villanova and have continued to sharpen my git and quarto skills as a data scientist. One downside to working with sensitive data is the opacity of my projects so I would like to find interesting ways to explore some of the ideas and concepts I use in my current role."

Kick, Snare, HH, Bass, Synth Riff, Vocals\n\nBeep Street - Squarepusher\n\nMan this snare roll is so sick (intro)\n(1 min 20 sec) I can really hear the influence on more recent artists.
